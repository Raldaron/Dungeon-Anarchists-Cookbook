    "content": "**Enchanted Night Wyrm's Ring of Divine Suffering**\n\nOooh, that's scary sounding.\n\nFor the discerning Crawler Killer, this magical ring can be one of the most formidable items in the dungeon. If utilized properly, this ring's wielder can grow exponentially in strength, especially on the deeper floors. But beware. If poorly wielded, this ring will kill you quicker than an exploding rage elemental. Either way, this ring imparts one of the dungeon's most highly sought-after skills.\n\n**Effects:**\n\n- The wearer of this ring receives the following benefits:\n\n  - +5% to all stats\n\n  - **The Marked for Death Skill:**\n\n    - It's not just Steven Seagal's magnum opus. It's also one of the dungeon's greatest, most infamous skills!\n\n    - Once activated, you will be presented with a list of all crawlers within your map's range.\n\n    - Only crawlers with 100% health will be selectable. Once a crawler is chosen, they will be marked. It takes 30 seconds for the mark to fully set and become active.\n\n    - When a crawler with an active mark dies, no matter the cause, you will receive a permanent +1 stat point to whatever that crawler's current highest stat is.\n\n    - The +1 stat benefit increases by one for every three marks you kill.\n\n    - **Warning:** Once a mark is set, you may no longer heal. If you are injured, or poisoned, or if you get a hangnail, you will suffer the ill effects and pain of that injury until the moment your prey is killed. So choose your marks carefully. Don't let them get away.\n\n    - You may only mark those designated as crawlers, except on the Scolopendra Lair levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) where you may also mark any non-dungeon-generated combatants.\n\n    - You may only mark one crawler at a time except on the ninth floor.\n\n    - This skill has a 5-hour cooldown on floors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.\n\n    - It has no cooldown on the 6th floor. Also on the sixth floor, marks form instantly.\n\n    - There is a 15-minute cooldown on the 9th floor, but there is no limit to the number of simultaneous marks.\n\n    - All remaining floors have no cooldown or delay to mark formation.\n\n- Happy Hunting!",
