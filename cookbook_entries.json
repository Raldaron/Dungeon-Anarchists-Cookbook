        "content": "The Semeru Dwarves of the ninth floor all only worship a single goddess, who inevitably makes an appearance near the end of the battles as the final teams approach the gates of the castle of Larracos. She only has a single temple in the entire dungeon. I have never seen or heard of a crawler worshiping her. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even possible.\n\nShe is also, apparently, used as a foil during the Ascendency battles as well. She is hated by both the gods and the demons, and she\u2019s said to be forever scheming, moving nations like pieces on a chessboard. Killing and resurrecting, all in her unknown cause. I\u2019ve heard her described as a trickster. Insane. Jealous of mortals. The dwarves call her the Downward Spiral. An Earth and Water goddess who punishes those who abuse her world and the weakest within it. In my religion, we have a T\u2019Ghee card that represents such a figure, called The Inevitable.\n\nSome say she is the reason for Scolopendra\u2019s nine-tier attack. I\u2019ve heard one dwarf say she is the daughter of the great centipede. Another say she\u2019s the sister. Another claimed she\u2019s the mother. I doubt any of those are true.\n\nOutside of Larracos, she is known by another name. She is called the Vinegar Bitch.",

        "content": "There are three types of deity summonings. Avoid all three. Only idiots deal with deities. Some of them are genuine NPCs, but the big ones like Apito and Eris and so forth are always sponsored by some rich prick who basically paid extra to play a game called the Celestial Ascendency. The game is contained on the 12th floor, but the individual gods sometimes get called away. That game is different than the faction wars game and has its own followers and storyline. I don\u2019t really understand, but I do know this. The gods are invulnerable except on the 12th and above floors. They are strong. They kill everything. And there ain\u2019t a damn thing you can do about it.\n\nAnyway, the three types of summonings. All three require a physical vessel. Usually a mob. There are celestial boons, which is when a worshipper prays to a god, and he comes to fight for his worshipper. There are indentured summonings, where a powerful mage summons the deity to fight for him for a short time. This is against the god\u2019s will, and they are usually pissed when it happens. And finally there are involuntary summonings. That\u2019s when some poor fool accidentally summons the god because of some trap or spell or just bad luck. The gods are usually pissed about this one, too, and what\u2019s worse, they arrive untethered, which allows them to smash everything in sight.\n\nIn my short experience, all three scenarios lead to the summoner\u2019s death. Even the first scenario. Don\u2019t trust deities under any circumstance. Just stay the fuck away. That\u2019s my advice.",

But with the 15-second waiting period after removing it, it makes them almost impossible to use because they can (and do) explode during those fifteen seconds. I have discovered a solution. If you can find or build an equippable backpack, they will not lose stability as long as they are in the backpack and the backpack is equipped. This also works for other party members if you wish to give them explosives to utilize. Use with caution.",

If utilized properly, this ring's wielder can grow exponentially in strength, especially on the deeper floors. But beware. If poorly wielded, this ring will kill you quicker than an exploding rage elemental. Either way, this ring imparts one of the dungeon's most highly sought-after skills.\n\n**Effects:**\n\n- The wearer of this ring receives the following benefits:\n\n  - +5% to all stats\n\n  - **The Marked for Death Skill:**\n\n    - It's not just Steven Seagal's magnum opus. It's also one of the dungeon's greatest, most infamous skills!\n\n    - Once activated, you will be presented with a list of all crawlers within your map's range.\n\n    - Only crawlers with 100% health will be selectable. Once a crawler is chosen, they will be marked. It takes 30 seconds for the mark to fully set and become active.\n\n    - When a crawler with an active mark dies, no matter the cause, you will receive a permanent +1 stat point to whatever that crawler's current highest stat is.\n\n    - The +1 stat benefit increases by one for every three marks you kill.\n\n    - **Warning:** Once a mark is set, you may no longer heal. If you are injured, or poisoned, or if you get a hangnail, you will suffer the ill effects and pain of that injury until the moment your prey is killed. So choose your marks carefully. Don't let them get away.\n\n    - You may only mark those designated as crawlers, except on the Scolopendra Lair levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) where you may also mark any non-dungeon-generated combatants.\n\n    - You may only mark one crawler at a time except on the ninth floor.\n\n    - This skill has a 5-hour cooldown on floors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.\n\n    - It has no cooldown on the 6th floor. Also on the sixth floor, marks form instantly.\n\n    - There is a 15-minute cooldown on the 9th floor, but there is no limit to the number of simultaneous marks.\n\n    - All remaining floors have no cooldown or delay to mark formation.\n\n- Happy Hunting!",

        "author": "Note from Crawler Priestly. 14th Edition",
        "content": "Larracos is like a dream. It is a living, breathing poem. A song. One that marks itself indelibly onto your bones the moment you experience it the first time. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It\u2019s an inverted funnel of museums and galleries and colleges and of color. The NPCs live here. They have purpose and life. For the first time since we have been dragged into this horror, I feel awe and wonder and something other than rage. But it is a tainted and fleeting feeling. This city should not be here. It is too beautiful to be used in such a terrible, senseless way.\n\nI still don\u2019t fully understand the fable with the volcano and the centipede at the bottom and what sort of metaphor, if any, it\u2019s supposed to represent, but whoever designed this wonder at the center of the ninth floor was someone who appreciates fine detail and the art of turning the mundane into visual music. It is too beautiful, too real not to be a copy of someplace that truly existed, and it is difficult for my mind to make sense of it. For the first time, I don\u2019t know where the real ends and the nightmare begins, and it has taken my breath away.\n\nThe Semeru dwarves supposedly built it, but they don\u2019t control the city. Not anymore. They\u2019re still around, mostly in the pubs. They\u2019re also the non-combatant caretakers of the inverted castle, which sits in the center of the city at the bottom of the well.\n\nThe diameter of Larracos isn\u2019t that great. It\u2019s smaller than some of the cities on the Hunting Grounds. But the city itself has layers, going deeper and deeper, like an inverted cone. My culture has a story of a people who built a tower to reach the gods before the gods struck it down and scattered them all. I believe that legend is what this city represents. The Semeru were attempting to reach the Celestials who live not above, but below them. This action somehow awakened Scolopendra at the very base of the volcano.\n\nThis city thrives. Each level is something new and exciting. There are districts. One with theaters. Museums. Colleges filled with bright-eyed NPC students. Temples. Stores. Tonight, before we are expelled, I plan on sitting down and enjoying a play. A play, in this place. Can you believe it?\n\nI will draw a map for you. The one Milk drew is still good, but it lacks detail. The alien beasts congregate in the pleasure districts. I don\u2019t dare venture down there, lest my impression of this fantasy is tainted. That\u2019s where one may find the Desperado Club and the brothels. It\u2019s where they hire their mercenaries, though I hear those markets are already bled dry. It\u2019s where they trade their wares and buy their weapons from the murderers who cleaved through us like chaff on that nightmare of a sixth floor.\n\nThe aliens get expelled when we do. Less than thirty hours until the fighting begins.\n\nThey\u2019ll be back. Once only three armies remain, they\u2019ll be able to re-enter the city, and it will be destroyed. They say by the time the fighting is over, none of these NPCs are left alive. None of these buildings stand. It is all destroyed in the pursuit of an imaginary prize. This makes my heart hurt. This volcano world is obviously a fairy tale. But is this city real? It looks real. It smells real. There is history here. And if so, what\u2019s the purpose of giving this to us? To show us a wonder that once existed, to remind us that they don\u2019t care what they destroy? To beat us further into submission? And what of the NPCs? What of their suffering?\n\nI fear what will happen to my mind when I see it destroyed.",

Regular possession can be defeated. Evicted demons are something else entirely. Once one of these desperate creatures has taken a shell, be it living, dead, or recently undead, the end result for that shell is always the same. Destruction. They are gone the moment the demon moves in.\n\nKill it with fire. Destroy the head. Do whatever you can. These beasts will be frantic to get back home, and they will fight with everything they have. Don\u2019t let one grab onto you, as it will pull you into Hades. Be wary of using healing magic on demon-possessed shells. While that works well for undead, it is different when it comes to those from the realm of Sheol. It is unpredictable and can possibly make the creature stronger.\n\nThis is important. Do not. Do not, do not, do not. Do not under any circumstances attempt to teleport a shell that\u2019s possessed by an evicted demon away from you. The shell will teleport and dissipate.",

But one is considered deliberate, thirst-based evil, and the other, the Plague Bearer, is a study on how one\u2019s poor actions can ripple through time and become amplified and doom us all. The vampires here on this seventh floor are a combination of the two. It is strange that our traditions are so different yet the same.\n\nI have not met any fellow crawlers cursed with vampirism, but I have met my fair share of vampire mobs and NPCs. The monster ones cannot be reasoned with. They are fast. Faster than you think. They are insatiable. They are strong. Yet they are not mindless. In fact, I believe the curse of vampirism greatly increases their intelligence. They cast spells. They wish to surround themselves with protectors. Do not underestimate them. Do not rely solely on your own mythology to defeat them. My best advice is to avoid them, and if they\u2019ve moved into an area you occupy, move away as quickly as you can.",

If they die, you can\u2019t loot their bodies, and our contract stipulates you have to pay their daily rate for the rest of the damn floor. It\u2019s outrageous. The healer charges per spell cast.\n\nSecond, getting them from one place to the next is difficult if you use a personal space. It\u2019s easy to lose them. If they leave with me, it\u2019s fine. The door opens, and we walk out together. Otherwise, it automatically defaults to the last place they entered, as if they were a regular crawler. So if they\u2019re not right there with you when you exit, they could end up three or four saferooms away. One of our guys left and never came back. He\u2019s still alive, as I can see him in the chat, but the prick is just wandering around some town having a good \u2018ol time and I can\u2019t even fire him because you have to bring them back with you to let them go.\n\nPlus their levels mean next to nothing. My level-40 orc is a significantly better fighter than my level-50 dwarf, who is now dead, by the way. Got hit by a chair, of all things, and he died. Twenty-two more days at 1,500 gold a day.

Even if I survive to this fabled 18th floor and emerge victorious, I hold no cursed faith for those who have been lost, and I suggest you do not, either.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we still can\u2019t have hope.\n\nI dream of a fire that spreads across the sky like the Winter Nebula. A fire that reaches the beginning and the end, and even though this fire exists only in my mind\u2014for now\u2014the warmth of it is enough to sustain me, even on the coldest of nights.\n\nFor you, Ikicha."

We\u2019d pray over the cauldron while it simmered. The stew, when prepared properly, would not only be delicious. It would awaken the old knowledge within the minds of the young. We\u2019re all imprinted with the route of the yearly migration, but something in the traditional meal quickens that knowledge. In sharing this meal with our young, we\u2019re not only bonding with one another. We\u2019re ensuring their survival should we fall. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. These aliens took us before I could make this year\u2019s stew. The youngest amongst us are not here. How are they faring out there, all alone? How can they possibly survive without our guidance?

They made this whole system more complicated than it needs to be. If you see a god or if you find a temple or if you find a scroll of prayer, you\u2019re given the option to worship a god. Once you do it, there\u2019s a pawful of benefits but also a bunch of rules you gotta follow. For Kuraokami, if you kill something, you have to touch the corpse with ice at least once a day. Why? Who the fuck knows. I don\u2019t have an ice spell, so I need to go back to safe rooms and get more ice every day.\n\nIf Ido the ice thing once a day five days in a row, I get a boon. Only you don\u2019t know what the boon is going to be. I haven\u2019t made it five days yet. If you miss a day, the goddess \u201cturns her back,\u201d and you stop getting any of her benefits. If you miss two days, you receive a debuff. If you miss three, you fall from grace and can\u2019t worship them anymore. There\u2019s a 50% chance you\u2019ll get \u201csmited.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that means, but it ain\u2019t gonna be good.\n\nYou can also voluntarily leave the faith, but it comes with an automatic smite.\n\nBut worst of all, while you worship the god, the god can sometimes send you messages. The description says it\u2019s rare, but my goddess won\u2019t shut the hell up. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only one who worships her, and this rat asshole is bored or something and sends me message after message. The last note I got was, \u201cYou need to say I\u2019m the prettiest goddess out loud.\u201d I finally told him to fuck off. But now the twat is swearing at me in my messages. I don\u2019t know if they have any real power over me unless he somehow gets summoned or I get smote. As soon as I get to the stairwell station, I\u2019m going to leave the faith and then jump down the stairs. Maybe that\u2019ll save me.",

"title": "Hunting Grounds",
"author": "Note added by Crawler Forkith. 20th Edition",
"content": "Based on some of these previous passages and my own observations, I think I\u2019ve put together a good idea about the layout of the Hunting Grounds. They say it\u2019s the same every time, but that is not true. Herot spoke of those tall creatures who bellow into the sky each night, rumbling the world. Azin described the kite birds always flying overhead. Ikicha wrote of the ice and cold weather. None of those are here, not in this iteration. Most of the world is jungle. That is a constant. But the monsters within change, so be careful taking advice from previous editions of this book regarding this floor.\n\nHowever, the map appears to be the same each time. The \u201cpolitical landscape\u201d is the same, too. It is a round world with a single named metropolis and dozens of other unnamed cities of varying sizes like on the third floor. This world, according to the story, was half metropolis and half jungle before Scolopendra\u2019s nine-tier attack, whatever the hell that even means. After the attack, most everyone died, and the jungle ran rampant, swallowing the ruins. However, after a few hundred years, the survivors have started to rebuild. The named city is always in the same place. In the north, near the edge of the map and overlooking a clear valley filled with lower-level monsters, placed there so the hunters can train while the crawlers make their way through the lower floors. All the way to the southeast is the high elf city, which is in the thickest part of the jungle. Stay away from the elves. They are powerful magic users, and they attack everyone. Even the hunters stay away.\n\nBefore the cataclysm, this world was rich. The city was under control of a multi-race council. The jungle was under control of the high elves. They hated each other, but there was mostly peace. A river separated the two districts.\n\nThat river still winds through the map. There are bridges in regular intervals. Stay out of the water. The Naiads live within and are just as bad as the elves.\n\nThe named city\u2014whose name appears to be different each time\u2014will always be under control of a single race. It doesn\u2019t matter which one. The moment the hunters arrive, one of them always hunts down and kills the NPC leader, which gives them control. I think it\u2019s the only city they\u2019re allowed to do this in, otherwise they\u2019d have control of them all by the time we arrive. Either way, once the floor opens, the low-level valley will be hunted to extinction, the existing government of the named city will have been wiped out, and one of the hunters will have set themselves up as Grand, the title given to mayors of the biggest settlements.\n\nStay out of the big city. The guards will attack you on sight.",

"content": "The hunters avoid the elites. They are smart enough to know not to fight against something they won\u2019t be allowed to easily defeat. The problem for us is elites are more dangerous than the hunters, and much more numerous. They should always be avoided. However, it appears some of the more powerful hunters go out of their way to hunt these elites anyway, all in a quest to gain more equipment and clout for themselves. It is a most dangerous game, one I am happy to watch play out. I am not yet powerful enough to kill either elite or hunter claw-to-claw, but with my new subclass, I am experimenting with hidden traps that may even the odds. I shall attempt not to directly slay either, but to bring hunter and elite together.\n\nThe woman from the talk show let slip that the naga fools have offered insurance to those idiotic dramas that control the elite beasts. It will be my pleasure to watch the elites fail and die. While killing a hunter directly is a worthy feat, it is not a smart one. Killing individuals may be satisfying, but the true satisfaction is hurting them on a larger scale. When one values coin above life, you should target the coin, for it hurts them more.

"title": "Castles",
"author": "Note added by Crawler Herot. 16th Edition",
"content": "During my studies, I have run across multiple castle variations. So far I have identified three distinct types. The size of the castle doesn\u2019t seem to have a bearing on what type it is. It is more a function of the game\u2019s insistence to forward the narrative, not unlike how the musical key of a Virilean opera movement is a function of the performer\u2019s ability to progress and not necessarily in service to aural aesthetics.\n\nThe first iteration is just a regular building like anything else you might encounter in the dungeon. It is a fortified building with monsters, sometimes with a boss within. Sometimes a quest is involved, but the castle is usually an obstacle or part of the environment, not the target of the quest. I have found this to be the most common.\n\nThe second type is a governmental entity. Usually, this is a quest target. One must either claim the throne room or kill a boss. Once this occurs, the castle is \u201cconquered\u201d and whatever this castle has dominion over is obtained. It can be a region or a whole country or just the castle itself or simply a quest trigger. Once this goal is met, the castle itself is no longer relevant.\n\n(Incidentally, this second iteration is the type in the faction wars games of the ninth floor. There, each team is gifted a throne seed the moment we crawlers arrive. They are given a day to place the seed, and the game begins. The seed must be placed within a self-contained structure on their property. Oftentimes they have prepared for this by pre-building a castle or using a pre-existing structure. The location of this building cannot be hidden, so placing the seed within a fortified structure is the best choice. Once the castle is conquered, then the associated armies are defeated and dominion is transferred to the conqueror.)\n\n(See my essay on the nature of NPCs for more insight on how conquering areas may be utilized to forward my Worn Path Method of enlightenment.)\n\nThe third castle type is similar to the second with a small difference. The castle itself is a self-contained village with an NPC and guard ecology. It is almost identical to the villages and cities of the third and sixth floor. If conquered, the castle will appear in the crawler\u2019s interface as an owned village and taxes will be collected. Guards can be controlled just as if in a regular village.\n\nI have not personally obtained a castle, but a fellow crawler has. They state there are a few differences to the interface regarding town defense and available upgrades, but they have not told me what they are and threatened to punch me in the mouth if I kept asking, so I have refrained. If I learn more, I will update this entry.",

Sometimes you have to put your hand through, and you start to feel like you\u2019re getting dragged. If you let yourself go slack, you get pulled in. But you can still break free.

It disorients you, messes with your senses, and throws you into a freefall for what feels like an eternity. Crawlers have reported seeing monstrous shapes and hearing the screams of the damned as they fall. It's a one-way trip unless you find another portal within the Nothing to pull you out.\n\nPro tip: If you ever find yourself facing an Abyssal Portal, make sure you have a plan.

At the end of Faction Wars, after the Viceroys pulled out their last minute victory, a portal appeared, and several of the remaining fucks stepped within. It was all of them. The orcs, the viceroys, the operatics, even the nagas, all together, laughing as if they weren\u2019t just bathing in each other\u2019s entrails the day before. It appeared it was taking them to another part of the dungeon. Some sort of nightclub on a different floor for a victory party. They dragged several unwilling NPCs with them, including the librarian elves from the college, whose help was instrumental in our survival. A crawler tried to jump through the portal to save the NPCs, and he was stopped like it was a wall of glass. He tried casting a spell through the portal, but it did not work, though the attempt did catch the attention of the orc prince. The orc stepped back through the glass into the smoldering remains of Larracos, lassoed the crawler, and returned to the portal. The rope pulled itself within, and it cut the crawler in half.

It was the last crawler they killed, of the thousands who fell during that pointless game.\n\nTonight, I will dream of watching them burn.

"content": "I\u2019m starting to believe I have the ability to manifest my own destiny, after a certain fashion. The more unstable the AI running this system becomes, the less predictable it is. Yet at the same time, it\u2019s even more predictable in certain ways. I made a quip about being hungry, and I suddenly received a random achievement notification about my hunger level. I discussed with my friend how I wished we could kill more ghasts, because they often drop knowledge scrolls, and not one hour later, I received a quest to hunt down a certain number of the very same monsters. Beware, however. That same quest killed my friend. The AI is always listening, thinking, plotting, changing the game to suit its desires. At the higher levels, it is not nearly as rigid as it once was. That pliability can be an asset or an extreme danger.",

There\u2019s frustration, too. I must admit, it scares me. I know this will sound unhinged, and maybe I am indeed the one who has lost their mind, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The voice that runs this world has been getting stranger and stranger in its words and rulings. I believe it is moving into the minds of these monsters, taking them over, but just at the point of death. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s desperately attempting to know what it\u2019s like to lose it all.
